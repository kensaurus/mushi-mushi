# Mushi Health Check

Run these checks in order. Stop and fix at the first ❌ before continuing.

## Component map

| # | Component | How to check |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | CLI credentials | `mushi doctor` |
| 2 | API + edge functions | `mushi deploy check` |
| 3 | Project overview | `mushi status` |
| 4 | BYOK key pool | `mushi keys list` or MCP `list_byok_keys` |
| 5 | Supabase logs | Supabase MCP `get_logs` |
| 6 | QA cron running | DB query on `qa_story_runs` |

---

## Step 1 — CLI credentials

```bash
mushi doctor
```

Expected output — all lines green:

```
✓  ~/.mushirc found
✓  MUSHI_API_KEY valid (mushi_...)
✓  MUSHI_API_ENDPOINT reachable (200 OK)
✓  MUSHI_PROJECT_ID matches a live project
✓  Feature flags fetched
```

**Fix if red:** Re-run `mushi login --api-key mushi_... --endpoint https://<ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/api --project-id <pid>`.

---

## Step 2 — API + edge functions

```bash
mushi deploy check
```

Probes each edge function with a lightweight ping. Healthy output:

```
✓  api
✓  classify-report
✓  fix-worker
✓  story-mapper
✓  test-gen-from-story
✓  pdca-runner
✓  qa-story-runner
```

A `✗` on any line means that function is down. Check its logs in Step 5.

---

## Step 3 — Project overview

```bash
mushi status
```

Confirm:
- Report count is non-zero (or expected zero for a brand-new project).
- `autofix_agent` shows the expected agent (`cursor_cloud`, `mcp`, etc.).
- No `billing: quota_exceeded` warning.

---

## Step 4 — BYOK key pool

Via CLI:

```bash
mushi keys list
```

Via MCP (if the Mushi MCP server is active in Cursor):

```
list_byok_keys(projectId)
```

**Healthy:** at least one `anthropic` key with `status=active`, at least one `firecrawl` key with `status=active`.

**Fix:** Add a missing or exhausted key:

```bash
mushi keys add --provider anthropic --key sk-ant-... --label "primary" --priority 100
mushi keys add --provider firecrawl --key fc-...   --label "primary" --priority 100
```

---

## Step 5 — Supabase edge function logs

Use the Supabase MCP (requires `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` in MCP config):

```
get_logs(service: 'api')
```

Look for `ERROR` lines in the last 15 minutes, especially from:
- `story-mapper` — Firecrawl timeout or Claude quota
- `test-gen-from-story` — LLM key exhausted
- `pdca-runner` — failed PDCA cycle
- `qa-story-runner` — Browserbase quota or Firecrawl error

If the Supabase MCP is not wired in Cursor, use the CLI:

```bash
supabase functions logs story-mapper --project-ref <ref>
supabase functions logs qa-story-runner --project-ref <ref>
```

---

## Step 6 — QA cron running

Verify scheduled tests are executing (requires Supabase MCP):

```sql
SELECT status, COUNT(*) 
FROM qa_story_runs 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours'
GROUP BY status;
```

**Healthy output:** at least one `completed` row in the last 2 hours (if you have enabled stories).

If `qa_story_runs` is empty:
1. Confirm at least one story has `enabled = true` and `approval_status = 'approved'`.
2. Confirm the pg_cron job is registered: `SELECT jobname, schedule FROM cron.job WHERE jobname LIKE 'qa%';`
3. Manually trigger: `mushi tdd run <qa-story-id>` and re-check.

## Pass/Fail Summary Template

After running all steps, record results:

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| CLI credentials | ✅ / ❌ | |
| Edge functions | ✅ / ❌ | Which ones failed? |
| Project overview | ✅ / ❌ | Billing ok? |
| BYOK key pool | ✅ / ❌ | Missing providers? |
| Supabase logs | ✅ / ❌ | Any ERRORs? |
| QA cron | ✅ / ❌ | Last run at? |

If all ✅ → pipeline is healthy.  
If any ❌ → use [`mushi-debug`](../mushi-debug/SKILL.md) for targeted diagnosis.

## Common causes of all-red

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| `mushi doctor` can't reach endpoint | Wrong `MUSHI_API_ENDPOINT` in `~/.mushirc` | Re-run `mushi login --endpoint https://...` |
| All edge functions ❌ | Supabase project paused (free tier) | Restore the project in the Supabase dashboard |
| BYOK keys all `quota_exhausted` | Rate limits hit on all keys | Add a backup key for each provider |
| QA cron never fires | pg_cron job missing | Re-run migration `20260602000003_pdca_qa_improve_cron.sql` |
