# @mushi-mushi/capacitor

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 71b2fe8: Full-PDCA dogfood hardening wave (2026-04-22).

  Web SDK:
  - New `@mushi-mushi/web/test-utils` entry-point exposing `triggerBug()`,
    `openReport()`, and `waitForQueueDrain()` for deterministic Playwright
    round-trips. Import from `@mushi-mushi/web/test-utils` — zero cost at
    runtime for production bundles.
  - Tightened size-limit budget to 15 KB gzipped (previously 30 KB
    uncompressed). No API changes.

  Core SDK:
  - No code changes; bumped for consistency with the `web` SDK so
    downstream frameworks pick up the new test-utils exports transitively.

  Framework SDKs (react / vue / svelte / angular / react-native /
  capacitor / node):
  - No code changes. Coupled minor bump so the workspace stays on a single
    MAJOR.MINOR track; patch-only drift across adapters has historically
    caused dependency-resolution confusion for customers.

  Launcher:
  - Rewired the Claude Code agent adapter behind the new
    `MUSHI_ENABLE_CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT=1` flag and wired it up to the local
    `claude` CLI (binary path overridable via `MUSHI_CLAUDE_CODE_BIN`).
    The README "Status" column now reflects "working — opt-in".

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- 6e01dc7: Ship `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `SECURITY.md` inside every published tarball, and enable npm provenance (sigstore-signed build attestation) for every publishable package. Both changes target package-health signals surfaced by Snyk (`security.snyk.io/package/npm/<name>`) and Socket (`socket.dev/npm/package/<name>`):
  - **Community files in-tarball.** Snyk and Socket only credit community signals when the files are shipped inside the npm tarball, not when they live at the monorepo root. A pre-commit guard (`scripts/sync-community-files.mjs --check`) and the `pnpm release` script now auto-sync from the canonical root copies to prevent drift.
  - **`publishConfig.provenance: true` everywhere.** The Release workflow already set `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE=true` at the job level, but per-package `publishConfig` is the explicit signal Socket reads for its Supply Chain score. `@mushi-mushi/cli`, `create-mushi-mushi`, and `mushi-mushi` already had it; the remaining 20 publishable packages now match.
  - **`.github/FUNDING.yml`** points at GitHub Sponsors so the repo exposes a funding signal to scanners and the GitHub UI.

  No runtime behaviour changes. No breaking changes for consumers.

### Patch Changes

- fc5c58e: **One-command setup wizard + npm discoverability sweep.**
  - **`@mushi-mushi/cli` `0.3.0`**: New `mushi init` command — interactive wizard built on `@clack/prompts` that auto-detects framework (Next, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Angular, Expo, Capacitor, plain React/Vue/Svelte, vanilla), package manager (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun), installs the right SDK, writes env vars with the right prefix (`NEXT_PUBLIC_`, `NUXT_PUBLIC_`, `VITE_`), warns when `.env.local` isn't gitignored, and prints the framework-specific snippet. Idempotent: never overwrites existing `MUSHI_*` env vars. Exposes new `./init` and `./detect` subpath exports for downstream packages.
  - **`mushi-mushi` `0.3.0` (NEW, unscoped)**: One-command launcher — `npx mushi-mushi` runs the wizard. Gives the SDK a single brand entry point on npm so users don't have to know to look under `@mushi-mushi/*` first.
  - **`create-mushi-mushi` `0.3.0` (NEW)**: `npm create mushi-mushi` — same wizard via the standard npm-create convention.
  - **All 16 published packages**: keyword sweep — every package now ships `mushi-mushi` plus its framework-specific terms (`react`, `next.js`, `vue`, `nuxt`, `svelte`, `sveltekit`, `angular`, `react-native`, `expo`, `capacitor`, `ionic`, etc.) plus product terms (`session-replay`, `screenshot`, `shake-to-report`, `sentry-companion`, `error-tracking`, `ai-triage`) for npm search ranking.
  - **All SDK READMEs**: discoverability cross-link header at the top — points users to the wizard and to every other framework SDK so people who land on `@mushi-mushi/react` can find `@mushi-mushi/vue` and vice-versa.
  - **Root README**: quick-start now leads with `npx mushi-mushi`, with the manual install path documented as the fallback. Packages table gains a row for the launcher.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 7567cee: # v0.8.0 — mobile parity, A2A discovery, SOC 2 readiness, residency, BYO storage, BYOK

  closes the platform-parity gap with the V5.3 whitepaper. Mobile gets
  first-class native SDKs, the public agent surface becomes A2A-discoverable,
  and customers gain the operational levers (residency, storage, keys, audit
  evidence) needed to run Mushi in regulated environments.

  This release is **non-breaking** for existing SDK consumers. New surface only.

  ## Highlights
  - **Native iOS SDK** (`MushiMushi`, SwiftPM + CocoaPods): shake-to-report
    widget, offline queue with SQLite-backed retry, automatic device context
    capture, screenshot capture via `UIGraphicsImageRenderer`, optional Sentry
    bridge for unified breadcrumbs, and a macOS GitHub Actions matrix.
    (V5.3 §2.18)
  - **Native Android SDK** (`dev.mushimushi:sdk`, Maven Central + AAR):
    feature-equivalent to the iOS SDK — shake detection via `SensorManager`,
    bottom-sheet capture UI, `OfflineQueue` with `WorkManager`-style retry,
    Sentry breadcrumb bridge, and Android CI. (V5.3 §2.18)
  - **Flutter SDK** (`mushi_mushi` on pub.dev): pure-Dart with platform
    channel bridges, `RepaintBoundary`-driven screenshot capture, shake
    detection via `sensors_plus`, and reuses the same offline-queue
    contract as the JS Core SDK. (V5.3 §2.18)
  - **Capacitor plugin** (`@mushi-mushi/capacitor`): web fallback delegates
    to `@mushi-mushi/core`; native iOS/Android delegate to the standalone
    native SDKs so a hybrid app gets the same shake/screenshot UX as a
    native app. (V5.3 §2.18)
  - **A2A Agent Card discovery**: public endpoints
    `GET /.well-known/agent-card` and `GET /v1/agent-card` advertise the
    Mushi agent's identity, skills, supported A2A versions, MCP transport
    details and auth requirements per the A2A protocol. Other agents can
    now negotiate with the Mushi platform without out-of-band config.
    (V5.3 §2.19)
  - **SOC 2 Type 1 readiness module**: new tables
    `project_retention_policies`, `data_subject_requests`, `soc2_evidence`,
    the `mushi_apply_retention()` and `mushi_rls_coverage_snapshot()`
    SECURITY DEFINER helpers, a nightly `soc2-evidence` Edge Function, and
    a new admin **Compliance** page that surfaces the latest control
    evidence (CC6.1, CC6.7, CC7.2, CC8.1, A1.2), DSAR queue, and per-table
    retention policies. (V5.3 §2.20)
  - **Data residency regions (US / EU / JP)**: opt-in pinning per project,
    cluster-aware `regionRouter` middleware that 307-redirects cross-region
    calls, an SDK-side `resolveRegionEndpoint` that primes a localStorage
    cache so subsequent calls go straight to the right cluster, and a
    public `region_routing` lookup table. The US cluster remains the
    catalog of record for project metadata. (V5.3 §2.21)
  - **BYO Storage abstraction** (`s3` / `r2` / `gcs` / `minio` / `supabase`):
    per-project `project_storage_settings`, a vault-backed credential model
    (no raw keys in DB), a zero-dependency `StorageAdapter` with inline
    SigV4 and GCS JWT signing, a healthcheck endpoint, and a new admin
    **Storage** page. Screenshots are now uploaded through the adapter
    end-to-end. (V5.3 §2.22)
  - **BYOK Anthropic / OpenAI keys end-to-end**: `resolveLlmKey` now
    flows through `fast-filter`, `classify-report` (text + vision), and
    `judge-batch`. Every LLM invocation records `key_source` (`byok`
    vs `env`) for billing reconciliation and SOC 2 evidence. New admin
    endpoints `GET / PUT / DELETE /v1/admin/byok/:provider` write keys
    to Supabase Vault via SECURITY DEFINER `vault_store_secret`, never
    to plain DB columns. New **Settings → LLM Keys** panel exposes
    rotation, clearing, and last-used timestamps with `…<last4>` hints.
    (V5.3 §2.23)

  ## Migrations included

  `20260418001300_soc2_readiness`, `20260418001400_data_residency`,
  `20260418001500_byo_storage`, `20260418001600_byok_key_source`.

  ## New packages
  - `@mushi-mushi/capacitor@0.2.0` — Capacitor plugin published to npm.
  - `MushiMushi` (iOS) — published to CocoaPods + SwiftPM.
  - `dev.mushimushi:sdk` (Android) — published to Maven Central.
  - `mushi_mushi` (Flutter) — published to pub.dev.

  ## Breaking changes

  None.

  ## Operator notes
  - **Region rollout**: a single-region deploy continues to work unchanged.
    To enable EU/JP, deploy a sibling Supabase project per region, set
    `MUSHI_REGION` on each Edge Function deployment, and CNAME
    `eu.api.mushimushi.dev` / `jp.api.mushimushi.dev` to the corresponding
    cluster. SDKs auto-discover via `/v1/region/resolve` — no SDK upgrade
    required for old clients (they just won't get the redirect optimization).
  - **BYO Storage**: secrets MUST be loaded into Supabase Vault before being
    referenced from `project_storage_settings`. The settings table only
    stores the _vault entry name_; misconfiguration falls back to the
    cluster default Supabase bucket and surfaces in the storage healthcheck
    as `degraded` rather than failing reports.
  - **BYOK**: rotating a key is non-destructive — the old vault entry is
    overwritten and the next LLM call picks up the new value within one
    second (settings cache TTL). To force every node to drop its cached
    resolution, the admin UI's **Clear** button issues a Vault delete plus
    a settings upsert that nulls the ref column.
  - **SOC 2**: the nightly evidence sweep and retention sweep are scheduled
    via `pg_cron`. Verify both jobs are active with
    `SELECT jobname, schedule FROM cron.job WHERE jobname LIKE 'soc2-%' OR jobname LIKE 'mushi-%';`.
  - **A2A Agent Card** is intentionally public (no auth) so peer agents can
    discover Mushi. It advertises auth requirements but never the keys
    themselves.
