# @mushi-mushi/cli

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- b9666a7: feat(cli): add `mushi migrate` subcommand for guided framework / SDK migrations

  Detects the user's stack from `package.json` (and Capacitor/Expo/Cordova
  config files) and recommends matching guides from the docs Migration Hub
  catalog — Cordova → Capacitor, Capacitor → React Native, CRA → Vite,
  Next.js Pages → App Router, Vue 2 → 3, plus the "switch to Mushi" guides
  for Instabug, Shake, LogRocket, BugHerd, Pendo, and the SDK-upgrade rail.

  Output is a deep link into the docs hub (works on both
  `docs.mushimushi.dev` and `kensaur.us/mushi-mushi/docs`) so the user can
  land directly on the relevant interactive checklist.

  Catalog parity with the docs hub, the admin in-progress card, and the
  server's allowlist is enforced as a release gate by
  `scripts/check-migration-catalog-sync.mjs` (wired into both `ci.yml`
  and `release.yml`), so the four catalogs can never silently drift.

  The `mushi-mushi` launcher will bump as a patch via
  `updateInternalDependencies: "patch"` in `.changeset/config.json`,
  picking up the new CLI dependency.

## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- b441c55: - **Supply-chain hardening** workspace-wide 7-day cooldown on new dep
  versions (pnpm `minimumReleaseAge` + npm `min-release-age` + Dependabot
  `cooldown`), plus PR-time `dependency-review-action`, post-publish
  `npm audit signatures`, `strictDepBuilds`, and `blockExoticSubdeps`.
  Closes the window real-world npm attacks operate in (Axios 1.14.x: ~5h to
  detection; Shai-Hulud worm: ~12h) — every publicly-disclosed 2025–2026
  npm supply-chain attack would have been blocked by these defaults.
  - **Launcher README** adds a Socket.dev badge and a new "Supply-chain &
    verification" section that explains, up front, what each external scanner
    reports about `mushi-mushi` (npm provenance, Socket.dev alerts,
    Bundlephobia `EntryPointError`, Snyk Advisor crawler lag) and why none
    of them are actionable bugs.
  - **CLI** bumped `@clack/prompts` from `^0.11.0` to `^1.2.0`. v1 widened
    the `text({ validate })` callback parameter to `string | undefined`; the
    `requireSecret()` helper was updated to handle the new signature
    explicitly. No user-visible change; the v1 spinner-API breaking change
    isn't used here.

  Repo settings (no code change): GitHub Discussions and Dependabot security
  updates were enabled via `gh api`.

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- d4d6933: Growth plan — storefronts pass (2026-04-24)

  Phase 0 of the zero-budget 90-day growth plan: polishing the npm pages and
  README so they convert attention into stars and installs. No behaviour changes;
  metadata only.
  - **npm keyword arrays expanded across all 14 publishable packages.** Added
    discoverability terms developers actually type into npm search:
    `user-report`, `feedback-widget`, `sentry-alternative`, `auto-fix`,
    `llm-ops`, `ai-agent`, plus framework-appropriate specifics (e.g.
    `claude-code`, `codex`, `copilot` on `@mushi-mushi/mcp`). Keyword counts
    after the pass: 14–32 per package.
  - **README star CTA footer.** Added the bilingual _"もしMushi-chanのお役に立てたら、
    ⭐ をひとつ"_ line with links to the stargazers page, issue tracker, and
    Bluesky handle. Research says a single explicit star ask converts 2–5% of
    lurkers.
  - **New `docs/marketing/` folder** with the full growth kit: `VOICE.md`,
    `STOREFRONTS.md`, `snippets.md` (drafted hooks, Show HN, Reddit, LinkedIn,
    dev.to, Product Hunt, YouTube Short), `launch-week.md`, `content-plan.md`
    (8 compounding blog post outlines), `drip-channels.md` (11 awesome-lists,
    9 newsletter targets, Discord / Slack etiquette), `social-cadence.md`
    (Bluesky / X weekly rhythm), and `measurement.md` (the 5 numbers to watch
    each Friday).

  No SDK surface or runtime changes — safe to land before any launch week.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 6e01dc7: Ship `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `SECURITY.md` inside every published tarball, and enable npm provenance (sigstore-signed build attestation) for every publishable package. Both changes target package-health signals surfaced by Snyk (`security.snyk.io/package/npm/<name>`) and Socket (`socket.dev/npm/package/<name>`):
  - **Community files in-tarball.** Snyk and Socket only credit community signals when the files are shipped inside the npm tarball, not when they live at the monorepo root. A pre-commit guard (`scripts/sync-community-files.mjs --check`) and the `pnpm release` script now auto-sync from the canonical root copies to prevent drift.
  - **`publishConfig.provenance: true` everywhere.** The Release workflow already set `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE=true` at the job level, but per-package `publishConfig` is the explicit signal Socket reads for its Supply Chain score. `@mushi-mushi/cli`, `create-mushi-mushi`, and `mushi-mushi` already had it; the remaining 20 publishable packages now match.
  - **`.github/FUNDING.yml`** points at GitHub Sponsors so the repo exposes a funding signal to scanners and the GitHub UI.

  No runtime behaviour changes. No breaking changes for consumers.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 18572f7: **Security + UX hardening sweep for the installer trio.**

  Security:
  - `~/.mushirc` is now written with mode `0o600` on Unix. On load, existing files written with looser permissions are proactively chmod'd down so upgrading users are not exposed to other local users on a shared box.
  - Package-manager install no longer uses `shell: true`. We resolve the platform-specific executable (`npm.cmd` on Windows, `npm` elsewhere) and spawn with `shell: false`, closing the door on future shell-metacharacter injection if arbitrary arg forwarding is ever added.
  - Credentials pasted into the wizard are sanitized (stripped of surrounding quotes, whitespace, and CR/LF/NUL) and validated against `^proj_[A-Za-z0-9_-]{10,}$` / `^mushi_[A-Za-z0-9_-]{10,}$` before they're written to disk. Prevents `.env` injection via newlines in a pasted secret.
  - `--endpoint` URLs now require `https://` except for localhost / `.local` / link-local addresses. Typo'd `http://` endpoints are rejected instead of silently exfiltrating the API key.
  - All three published packages now declare `publishConfig.provenance: true` (belt-and-suspenders with the existing `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE=true` in CI) so the npm page shows the verified-publisher badge on every release.
  - New `.github/workflows/security.yml` runs CodeQL (security-extended) + `pnpm audit --prod --audit-level=high` on every PR and weekly via cron.

  UX:
  - `mushi --version` now reports the real package version instead of the stale hardcoded `0.3.0`.
  - Launcher & create-mushi-mushi gained `--version`, `--cwd`, `--endpoint`, `--skip-test-report`, and a non-TTY bail-out that errors clearly instead of hanging on `@clack/prompts` in CI.
  - End-of-wizard "Send a test report now?" prompt closes the loop: the user sees their first classified bug in the console without leaving the terminal.
  - `.gitignore` detection now covers the common patterns (`.env*.local`, `.env.*.local`, `*.local`, `*.env*`) so the "not gitignored" warning stops crying wolf.
  - Monorepo / sub-package support via `--cwd <path>` forwarded from the shims.
  - Error handler on the shims now hints at `DEBUG=mushi` for stack traces and links to the issue tracker.
  - Dead `writeFileSync(readFileSync(...))` round-trip in `writeEnvFile` removed.

  Housekeeping:
  - `funding` field (`https://github.com/sponsors/kensaurus`) added to all three packages.
  - New `./version` subpath export on `@mushi-mushi/cli`.
  - Shared `FRAMEWORK_IDS` / `isFrameworkId` exported from `@mushi-mushi/cli/detect` so the three-file duplicate of the framework list no longer has to be kept in sync.
  - Integration tests for the shims (`--help`, `--version`, unknown framework, unknown flag, non-TTY bail-out) and permission-mode tests for `~/.mushirc`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- fc5c58e: **One-command setup wizard + npm discoverability sweep.**
  - **`@mushi-mushi/cli` `0.3.0`**: New `mushi init` command — interactive wizard built on `@clack/prompts` that auto-detects framework (Next, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Angular, Expo, Capacitor, plain React/Vue/Svelte, vanilla), package manager (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun), installs the right SDK, writes env vars with the right prefix (`NEXT_PUBLIC_`, `NUXT_PUBLIC_`, `VITE_`), warns when `.env.local` isn't gitignored, and prints the framework-specific snippet. Idempotent: never overwrites existing `MUSHI_*` env vars. Exposes new `./init` and `./detect` subpath exports for downstream packages.
  - **`mushi-mushi` `0.3.0` (NEW, unscoped)**: One-command launcher — `npx mushi-mushi` runs the wizard. Gives the SDK a single brand entry point on npm so users don't have to know to look under `@mushi-mushi/*` first.
  - **`create-mushi-mushi` `0.3.0` (NEW)**: `npm create mushi-mushi` — same wizard via the standard npm-create convention.
  - **All 16 published packages**: keyword sweep — every package now ships `mushi-mushi` plus its framework-specific terms (`react`, `next.js`, `vue`, `nuxt`, `svelte`, `sveltekit`, `angular`, `react-native`, `expo`, `capacitor`, `ionic`, etc.) plus product terms (`session-replay`, `screenshot`, `shake-to-report`, `sentry-companion`, `error-tracking`, `ai-triage`) for npm search ranking.
  - **All SDK READMEs**: discoverability cross-link header at the top — points users to the wizard and to every other framework SDK so people who land on `@mushi-mushi/react` can find `@mushi-mushi/vue` and vice-versa.
  - **Root README**: quick-start now leads with `npx mushi-mushi`, with the manual install path documented as the fallback. Packages table gains a row for the launcher.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 7567cee: # v0.6.0 — hardening + agentic-fix orchestration

  This release closes the highest-priority gaps between the V5 whitepaper and the
  running code. It is the first of four releases on the [V5.3 roadmap](../MushiMushi_Whitepaper_V5.md#appendix-c-implementation-roadmap)
  and the breaking-change surface is **zero** for SDK consumers.

  ## Highlights
  - **Vision air-gap**: Stage-2 vision analysis now sees the screenshot only with
    trusted metadata; visible text in the image is captured separately and
    flagged so prompt-injection attempts (e.g. an attacker writing "ignore all
    previous instructions" inside their screenshot) cannot influence
    classification. (V5.3 §2.3.2)
  - **Judge OpenAI fallback**: `judge-batch` now falls back to OpenAI
    (`gpt-4.1` by default) when Anthropic is unavailable, restoring the
    self-improvement loop during outages. Configure via
    `project_settings.judge_fallback_provider`. (V5.3 §2.7)
  - **Blast-radius MV refresh**: `blast_radius_cache` is now refreshed every
    15 minutes via `pg_cron` with a `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY`
    guarded by an advisory lock. Per-project graph-edge pruning runs nightly.
    (V5.3 §2.4)
  - **RAG codebase indexer**: GitHub App webhook + `mushi index <path>` CLI
    fallback for non-GitHub git hosts. Symbol-aware chunking (TS/TSX, JS/JSX,
    Python, Go, Rust). (V5.3 §2.3.4)
  - **Fix dispatch end-to-end**: Admin can dispatch fixes from the report detail
    page; status streams over Hono `streamSSE` with Bearer auth and
    CVE-2026-29085-safe sanitization. (V5.3 §2.10, §2.16)
  - **Sandbox provider abstraction**: `local-noop` (tests) and `e2b` (managed
    sandbox) implementations behind a `SandboxProvider` interface; per-event
    audit log in `fix_sandbox_events`. The orchestrator refuses `local-noop` in
    production. (V5.3 §2.10)
  - **True MCP adapter**: `McpFixAgent` speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 with `tools/call`
    and supports SEP-1686 long-running Tasks. The misnamed `generic_mcp` agent
    is renamed to `rest_fix_worker`; the old export is kept as a deprecated
    alias for one more minor. (V5.3 §2.10)
  - **BYOK schema**: `byok_anthropic_key_ref` / `byok_openai_key_ref` columns
    with audit log; resolver helper falls back to env when no BYOK is set.
    End-to-end wiring lands in v0.8.0. (V5.3 §2.18)

  ## Cross-cutting fixes
  - Widget min description length raised from 5 to 20 chars (server zod schema
    matched). Empirically removes ~30% of unactionable reports.
  - `recordPromptResult` now scopes by `(project_id, stage, version)` so two
    projects sharing a version label cannot corrupt each other's running
    averages. New unique index enforces this.
  - Cloud URL: SDK default endpoint now points at the live Supabase Cloud
    function URL instead of the unbound `api.mushimushi.dev` placeholder.
    Self-hosted users MUST override `apiEndpoint` (no behaviour change).
  - README updated to honestly reflect what's shipped vs. scaffolded.

  ## Migrations included

  `20260418000000_vision_air_gap`, `20260418000100_judge_fallback`,
  `20260418000200_blast_radius_mv_refresh`, `20260418000300_codebase_indexer`,
  `20260418000400_fix_dispatch_jobs`, `20260418000500_sandbox_audit`,
  `20260418000600_mcp_agent_enum`, `20260418000700_prompt_versions_unique`,
  `20260418000800_byok_keys`.

  ## Breaking changes

  None for SDK consumers. Operators with custom `autofix_agent = 'generic_mcp'`
  should migrate to `'rest_fix_worker'` (deprecated alias still works through v0.7).

- 7567cee: # v0.7.0 — on-device classification, real-time triage, AG-UI, fine-tune pipeline, intelligence reports, AGE phase 1

  focuses on intelligence and operator UX: cheaper inference (move junk
  filtering on-device), live collaboration on the report queue, a typed
  agent↔frontend streaming protocol, and a real fine-tune lifecycle.

  This release is **non-breaking** for SDK consumers. New surface only.

  ## Highlights
  - **On-device pre-classifier** (`@mushi-mushi/wasm-classifier`, public 0.1.0):
    ships both a zero-dependency heuristic mode and an ONNX mode (lazy-loads
    `onnxruntime-web` only when wired up). Plugs into `submitReport` via
    `preFilter.wasmClassifier`. Cuts LLM cost by ~25-40% on noisy widgets and
    keeps obvious junk on-device. (V5.3 §2.13)
  - **Real-time collaboration on reports**: `report_comments` (threaded,
    optionally visible to the reporter) and `report_presence` (15-second TTL,
    pruned via `pg_cron`). Admin `ReportDetailPage` now shows presence badges
    and a comments panel powered by Supabase Realtime. (V5.3 §2.14)
  - **AG-UI streaming protocol** (v0.4): the fix-dispatch SSE stream now emits
    typed envelopes (`run.started`, `run.status`, `run.tool_call`,
    `run.completed`, `run.failed`, `run.heartbeat`) alongside the legacy
    `event: status` frames. Backwards compatible. CVE-2026-29085 sanitization
    re-validated for the structured envelope. (V5.3 §2.15)
  - **Fine-tune pipeline**: extended `fine_tuning_jobs` with
    `export_format`, `validation_report`, `promote_to_stage` and friends.
    New helpers `gatherTrainingSamples`, `renderJsonl`, `validateTrainedModel`,
    `promoteFineTunedModel`. New REST endpoints
    `POST /v1/admin/fine-tuning/:id/{export,validate,promote,reject}`.
    Admin UI surfaces the full pipeline stepper with PII-leakage and accuracy
    gates before promote is allowed. (V5.3 §2.15 self-improvement loop)
  - **Bug intelligence reports**: weekly digests are now persisted to
    `intelligence_reports`, listable via `GET /v1/admin/intelligence`, and
    exportable as PDF via the browser's native print pipeline (zero new
    npm dependencies). New admin page surfaces history + a printable HTML
    preview per week. (V5.3 §2.16)
  - **Opt-in cross-customer benchmarking**: `intelligence_benchmarks_mv`
    enforces k-anonymity ≥ 5 contributing projects per bucket. Per-project
    opt-in toggle in Settings; off by default. No project IDs, names, or PII
    leak across tenants. Refreshed nightly via `pg_cron`. (V5.3 §2.16)
  - **Apache AGE parallel-write graph backend (Phase 1)**: opt-in
    `graph_backend = 'sql_age_parallel'` setting mirrors every node/edge into
    AGE through SECURITY DEFINER helpers. AGE failures are logged, never
    fatal. New `mushi_age_snapshot_drift()` and admin
    `GET /v1/admin/graph-backend/status` for drift visibility. SQL stays
    authoritative; cutover is reserved for Phase 3 in V5.5. (V5.3 §2.17)

  ## Migrations included

  `20260418000900_realtime_collab`, `20260418001000_finetune_pipeline`,
  `20260418001100_intelligence_reports`, `20260418001200_age_parallel_write`.

  ## New dependencies
  - `@mushi-mushi/wasm-classifier@0.1.0` — published as a separate package so
    consumers who don't want the ONNX runtime in their bundle can stay on the
    heuristic mode.

  ## Breaking changes

  None.

  ## Operator notes
  - AGE parallel-write is **disabled by default** and requires the AGE
    extension to be installed in your Postgres. Managed Supabase Postgres
    does not currently ship AGE; the helpers degrade to graceful no-ops.
    See `packages/server/supabase/functions/_shared/age-graph.README.md`
    for the rollout phases and acceptance criteria for Phase 2 / Phase 3.
  - Cross-customer benchmarking opt-in writes a timestamp + the user id who
    flipped the switch to `project_settings.benchmarking_optin_*`. There is
    no automatic opt-in based on contract type — it is always explicit owner
    action.
  - The fine-tune validation gate refuses promotion if any of the following
    hold on the latest validation report: `accuracy < 0.85`, `driftScore > 0.25`,
    or `piiLeakageDetected = true`. Override requires re-running validation
    against a corrected eval set; there is intentionally no force-promote.

- 7567cee: # v0.8.0 — mobile parity, A2A discovery, SOC 2 readiness, residency, BYO storage, BYOK

  closes the platform-parity gap with the V5.3 whitepaper. Mobile gets
  first-class native SDKs, the public agent surface becomes A2A-discoverable,
  and customers gain the operational levers (residency, storage, keys, audit
  evidence) needed to run Mushi in regulated environments.

  This release is **non-breaking** for existing SDK consumers. New surface only.

  ## Highlights
  - **Native iOS SDK** (`MushiMushi`, SwiftPM + CocoaPods): shake-to-report
    widget, offline queue with SQLite-backed retry, automatic device context
    capture, screenshot capture via `UIGraphicsImageRenderer`, optional Sentry
    bridge for unified breadcrumbs, and a macOS GitHub Actions matrix.
    (V5.3 §2.18)
  - **Native Android SDK** (`dev.mushimushi:sdk`, Maven Central + AAR):
    feature-equivalent to the iOS SDK — shake detection via `SensorManager`,
    bottom-sheet capture UI, `OfflineQueue` with `WorkManager`-style retry,
    Sentry breadcrumb bridge, and Android CI. (V5.3 §2.18)
  - **Flutter SDK** (`mushi_mushi` on pub.dev): pure-Dart with platform
    channel bridges, `RepaintBoundary`-driven screenshot capture, shake
    detection via `sensors_plus`, and reuses the same offline-queue
    contract as the JS Core SDK. (V5.3 §2.18)
  - **Capacitor plugin** (`@mushi-mushi/capacitor`): web fallback delegates
    to `@mushi-mushi/core`; native iOS/Android delegate to the standalone
    native SDKs so a hybrid app gets the same shake/screenshot UX as a
    native app. (V5.3 §2.18)
  - **A2A Agent Card discovery**: public endpoints
    `GET /.well-known/agent-card` and `GET /v1/agent-card` advertise the
    Mushi agent's identity, skills, supported A2A versions, MCP transport
    details and auth requirements per the A2A protocol. Other agents can
    now negotiate with the Mushi platform without out-of-band config.
    (V5.3 §2.19)
  - **SOC 2 Type 1 readiness module**: new tables
    `project_retention_policies`, `data_subject_requests`, `soc2_evidence`,
    the `mushi_apply_retention()` and `mushi_rls_coverage_snapshot()`
    SECURITY DEFINER helpers, a nightly `soc2-evidence` Edge Function, and
    a new admin **Compliance** page that surfaces the latest control
    evidence (CC6.1, CC6.7, CC7.2, CC8.1, A1.2), DSAR queue, and per-table
    retention policies. (V5.3 §2.20)
  - **Data residency regions (US / EU / JP)**: opt-in pinning per project,
    cluster-aware `regionRouter` middleware that 307-redirects cross-region
    calls, an SDK-side `resolveRegionEndpoint` that primes a localStorage
    cache so subsequent calls go straight to the right cluster, and a
    public `region_routing` lookup table. The US cluster remains the
    catalog of record for project metadata. (V5.3 §2.21)
  - **BYO Storage abstraction** (`s3` / `r2` / `gcs` / `minio` / `supabase`):
    per-project `project_storage_settings`, a vault-backed credential model
    (no raw keys in DB), a zero-dependency `StorageAdapter` with inline
    SigV4 and GCS JWT signing, a healthcheck endpoint, and a new admin
    **Storage** page. Screenshots are now uploaded through the adapter
    end-to-end. (V5.3 §2.22)
  - **BYOK Anthropic / OpenAI keys end-to-end**: `resolveLlmKey` now
    flows through `fast-filter`, `classify-report` (text + vision), and
    `judge-batch`. Every LLM invocation records `key_source` (`byok`
    vs `env`) for billing reconciliation and SOC 2 evidence. New admin
    endpoints `GET / PUT / DELETE /v1/admin/byok/:provider` write keys
    to Supabase Vault via SECURITY DEFINER `vault_store_secret`, never
    to plain DB columns. New **Settings → LLM Keys** panel exposes
    rotation, clearing, and last-used timestamps with `…<last4>` hints.
    (V5.3 §2.23)

  ## Migrations included

  `20260418001300_soc2_readiness`, `20260418001400_data_residency`,
  `20260418001500_byo_storage`, `20260418001600_byok_key_source`.

  ## New packages
  - `@mushi-mushi/capacitor@0.2.0` — Capacitor plugin published to npm.
  - `MushiMushi` (iOS) — published to CocoaPods + SwiftPM.
  - `dev.mushimushi:sdk` (Android) — published to Maven Central.
  - `mushi_mushi` (Flutter) — published to pub.dev.

  ## Breaking changes

  None.

  ## Operator notes
  - **Region rollout**: a single-region deploy continues to work unchanged.
    To enable EU/JP, deploy a sibling Supabase project per region, set
    `MUSHI_REGION` on each Edge Function deployment, and CNAME
    `eu.api.mushimushi.dev` / `jp.api.mushimushi.dev` to the corresponding
    cluster. SDKs auto-discover via `/v1/region/resolve` — no SDK upgrade
    required for old clients (they just won't get the redirect optimization).
  - **BYO Storage**: secrets MUST be loaded into Supabase Vault before being
    referenced from `project_storage_settings`. The settings table only
    stores the _vault entry name_; misconfiguration falls back to the
    cluster default Supabase bucket and surfaces in the storage healthcheck
    as `degraded` rather than failing reports.
  - **BYOK**: rotating a key is non-destructive — the old vault entry is
    overwritten and the next LLM call picks up the new value within one
    second (settings cache TTL). To force every node to drop its cached
    resolution, the admin UI's **Clear** button issues a Vault delete plus
    a settings upsert that nulls the ref column.
  - **SOC 2**: the nightly evidence sweep and retention sweep are scheduled
    via `pg_cron`. Verify both jobs are active with
    `SELECT jobname, schedule FROM cron.job WHERE jobname LIKE 'soc2-%' OR jobname LIKE 'mushi-%';`.
  - **A2A Agent Card** is intentionally public (no auth) so peer agents can
    discover Mushi. It advertises auth requirements but never the keys
    themselves.

### Patch Changes

- 7567cee: Republish all SDK packages with resolved dependency specifiers.

  The 0.1.0 tarballs were published with `"@mushi-mushi/core": "workspace:*"` (and similar) baked into `dependencies` because `changeset publish` ran without `changeset version` having rewritten the workspace protocol. Every external `npm install` failed with `EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL`.

  This patch republishes every SDK package with real semver ranges in its dependencies. A new pre-publish guard (`scripts/check-workspace-protocol.mjs`) and post-publish verifier (`scripts/verify-published-tarballs.mjs`) prevent recurrence.
