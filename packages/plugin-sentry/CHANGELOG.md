### Patch Changes

- 0c66aa9: Lock the Sentry User Feedback API path with explicit test coverage.

  The User Feedback path (preferred when an org auth token + a real
  `sentry_event_id` are both available) was previously only validated by
  manual smoke checks. Round 8 adds 5 specs covering: 200 happy path,
  409 idempotent re-delivery, 401 → 500 (so the dispatcher retries
  upstream), `sentry_event_id` missing → fall back to Store, auth token
  missing → fall back to Store. No runtime behaviour change.

### Patch Changes

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- 506df78: Release the full SDK + closed-loop evolution backlog since v0.5.0
  (`cf27d81`, 2026-05-10). Covers headless SDK, QA Coverage Suite,
  rewards program, native 0.4.0 parity, closed-loop Phases 0–6, and
  operator UX hardening for beta users.

  ### Headless SDK (minor — core / web / react / react-native)

  `MushiTrigger` (React + React Native) and `MushiAttach` (React) — wrap
  any element or DOM selector to trigger the Mushi widget without the
  floating button. The matching `SdkInstallCard` in the console now
  generates copy/paste snippets for both patterns.

  ### QA Coverage Suite (minor — core / web)

  Automated user-story tests run on cron through Playwright, Browserbase,
  or Firecrawl. Ships with `qa_stories` / `qa_story_runs` /
  `qa_story_evidence` schema, the `qa-story-runner` edge function, a
  pluggable browser-provider abstraction, and the full admin UI
  (`QaCoveragePage` + `QaCoverageTile`).

  ### Rewards program (minor — core / web / react / react-native)

  End-user rewards across all layers: configurable point rules,
  GDPR export, Stripe Connect payouts (Enterprise-gated), multi-step
  quests, SDK activity batching + tier badges, MCP catalog tools
  (`list_top_contributors`, `award_bonus_points`, `set_tier`).

  ### Closed-loop evolution — CLI + MCP (minor)
  - **`mushi sync-lessons`** — pulls promoted lessons from
    `/v1/admin/lessons` and writes `.mushi/lessons.json` into the
    connected repo (supports `--dry-run` and `--json`). Designed for
    CI and scheduled refresh PRs.
  - **MCP** — `lessons.query(diff_text, max_tokens)` tool for
    token-budget-ranked lesson injection into agent / PR-review flows;
    expanded catalog surface for Migration Hub and closed-loop resources.

  ### Native parity (Capacitor minor; iOS/Android via Cocoapods/Maven)

  Capacitor re-exports `addBreadcrumb` / `getBreadcrumbs` and the 0.4.0
  native parity modules (BreadcrumbCollector, ProactiveDetector,
  PIIScrubber, ExceptionNormaliser). iOS/Android SDKs ship at 0.4.0 via
  native package managers — not npm.

  ### Plugin packaging (patch)

  PR #98 fixed six plugin packages that shipped with `workspace:*`
  instead of `workspace:^`, which broke `npm install` for end users.

  ### Patch surfaces
  - `@mushi-mushi/{vue,svelte,angular}` — re-export headless trigger helpers.
  - `@mushi-mushi/plugin-sentry` — expanded inbound adapter surface.
  - `@mushi-mushi/plugin-sdk` — event schema extensions for rewards +
    experiment hooks.

  ### Server + admin (not in this npm release)

  The following ship via Supabase Edge Functions + admin deploy, not npm:
  - Closed-loop Phases 1–6: mistake clustering, releases + credits, PDCA
    iterate loop, contract drift walker, A/B experiments, anomaly detection,
    `/cost` panel.
  - Beta banner + structured project-create error UX + personal-org
    bootstrap on signup.
  - Seven new admin tabs: `/lessons`, `/releases`, `/iterate`, `/drift`,
    `/experiments`, `/anomalies`, `/cost`.
  - Docs: `closed-loop.mdx`, `EvolutionDiagram`, `LoopComparison`.
  - `SELF_HOSTED.md` updated with `mushi.edge_function_post()` cron
    patterns (replaces broken `current_setting('app.settings.*')` GUCs).

  ### Hermes compatibility fix (react-native — patch within minor)

  `packages/react-native/src/provider.tsx` — replaced `new Function()` with
  dynamic `import()` (which Hermes 0.84 rejects with `SyntaxError`) with
  `require()` wrapped in `try/catch` for both `@react-native-community/netinfo`
  and `expo-sensors`. The `shake` and `network` auto-triggers now work correctly
  on all Hermes-based RN apps. Companion admin-console improvements:
  - `apps/admin/src/lib/frameworkDetect.ts` (new) — paste-your-`package.json`
    framework + monorepo detector (React, Vue, Svelte, RN/Expo/Capacitor,
    Angular, Vanilla; npm/yarn/pnpm workspaces, Turborepo, Nx, Lerna, Rush)
    with confidence scoring, ELI5 guidance, and Hermes version warnings.
  - `SdkInstallCard.tsx` — integrates the detector: framework tab is auto-
    selected and monorepo install guidance is surfaced on paste.
  - `McpPage.tsx` — collapsible monorepo detector panel for workspace-scoped
    `mushi-mcp` install guidance.
  - `ProjectsPage.tsx` — copyable `MUSHI_PROJECT_ID` chip under each project
    card (answers the #1 "where do I find my project ID?" support question).
  - `packages/mcp/src/index.ts` — actionable warning when `MUSHI_PROJECT_ID`
    is not set, with direct link to the console.

### Patch Changes

- 6e01dc7: Ship `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `SECURITY.md` inside every published tarball, and enable npm provenance (sigstore-signed build attestation) for every publishable package. Both changes target package-health signals surfaced by Snyk (`security.snyk.io/package/npm/<name>`) and Socket (`socket.dev/npm/package/<name>`):
  - **Community files in-tarball.** Snyk and Socket only credit community signals when the files are shipped inside the npm tarball, not when they live at the monorepo root. A pre-commit guard (`scripts/sync-community-files.mjs --check`) and the `pnpm release` script now auto-sync from the canonical root copies to prevent drift.
  - **`publishConfig.provenance: true` everywhere.** The Release workflow already set `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE=true` at the job level, but per-package `publishConfig` is the explicit signal Socket reads for its Supply Chain score. `@mushi-mushi/cli`, `create-mushi-mushi`, and `mushi-mushi` already had it; the remaining 20 publishable packages now match.
  - **`.github/FUNDING.yml`** points at GitHub Sponsors so the repo exposes a funding signal to scanners and the GitHub UI.

  No runtime behaviour changes. No breaking changes for consumers.

### Patch Changes

- fc5c58e: **One-command setup wizard + npm discoverability sweep.**
  - **`@mushi-mushi/cli` `0.3.0`**: New `mushi init` command — interactive wizard built on `@clack/prompts` that auto-detects framework (Next, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Angular, Expo, Capacitor, plain React/Vue/Svelte, vanilla), package manager (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun), installs the right SDK, writes env vars with the right prefix (`NEXT_PUBLIC_`, `NUXT_PUBLIC_`, `VITE_`), warns when `.env.local` isn't gitignored, and prints the framework-specific snippet. Idempotent: never overwrites existing `MUSHI_*` env vars. Exposes new `./init` and `./detect` subpath exports for downstream packages.
  - **`mushi-mushi` `0.3.0` (NEW, unscoped)**: One-command launcher — `npx mushi-mushi` runs the wizard. Gives the SDK a single brand entry point on npm so users don't have to know to look under `@mushi-mushi/*` first.
  - **`create-mushi-mushi` `0.3.0` (NEW)**: `npm create mushi-mushi` — same wizard via the standard npm-create convention.
  - **All 16 published packages**: keyword sweep — every package now ships `mushi-mushi` plus its framework-specific terms (`react`, `next.js`, `vue`, `nuxt`, `svelte`, `sveltekit`, `angular`, `react-native`, `expo`, `capacitor`, `ionic`, etc.) plus product terms (`session-replay`, `screenshot`, `shake-to-report`, `sentry-companion`, `error-tracking`, `ai-triage`) for npm search ranking.
  - **All SDK READMEs**: discoverability cross-link header at the top — points users to the wizard and to every other framework SDK so people who land on `@mushi-mushi/react` can find `@mushi-mushi/vue` and vice-versa.
  - **Root README**: quick-start now leads with `npx mushi-mushi`, with the manual install path documented as the fallback. Packages table gains a row for the launcher.
