- d4d6933: Growth plan — storefronts pass (2026-04-24)

  Phase 0 of the zero-budget 90-day growth plan: polishing the npm pages and
  README so they convert attention into stars and installs. No behaviour changes;
  metadata only.
  - **npm keyword arrays expanded across all 14 publishable packages.** Added
    discoverability terms developers actually type into npm search:
    `user-report`, `feedback-widget`, `sentry-alternative`, `auto-fix`,
    `llm-ops`, `ai-agent`, plus framework-appropriate specifics (e.g.
    `claude-code`, `codex`, `copilot` on `@mushi-mushi/mcp`). Keyword counts
    after the pass: 14–32 per package.
  - **README star CTA footer.** Added the bilingual _"もしMushi-chanのお役に立てたら、
    ⭐ をひとつ"_ line with links to the stargazers page, issue tracker, and
    Bluesky handle. Research says a single explicit star ask converts 2–5% of
    lurkers.
  - **New `docs/marketing/` folder** with the full growth kit: `VOICE.md`,
    `STOREFRONTS.md`, `snippets.md` (drafted hooks, Show HN, Reddit, LinkedIn,
    dev.to, Product Hunt, YouTube Short), `launch-week.md`, `content-plan.md`
    (8 compounding blog post outlines), `drip-channels.md` (11 awesome-lists,
    9 newsletter targets, Discord / Slack etiquette), `social-cadence.md`
    (Bluesky / X weekly rhythm), and `measurement.md` (the 5 numbers to watch
    each Friday).

  No SDK surface or runtime changes — safe to land before any launch week.

### Patch Changes

- 6e01dc7: Ship `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `SECURITY.md` inside every published tarball, and enable npm provenance (sigstore-signed build attestation) for every publishable package. Both changes target package-health signals surfaced by Snyk (`security.snyk.io/package/npm/<name>`) and Socket (`socket.dev/npm/package/<name>`):
  - **Community files in-tarball.** Snyk and Socket only credit community signals when the files are shipped inside the npm tarball, not when they live at the monorepo root. A pre-commit guard (`scripts/sync-community-files.mjs --check`) and the `pnpm release` script now auto-sync from the canonical root copies to prevent drift.
  - **`publishConfig.provenance: true` everywhere.** The Release workflow already set `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE=true` at the job level, but per-package `publishConfig` is the explicit signal Socket reads for its Supply Chain score. `@mushi-mushi/cli`, `create-mushi-mushi`, and `mushi-mushi` already had it; the remaining 20 publishable packages now match.
  - **`.github/FUNDING.yml`** points at GitHub Sponsors so the repo exposes a funding signal to scanners and the GitHub UI.

  No runtime behaviour changes. No breaking changes for consumers.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 81336e9: Initial release — `@mushi-mushi/adapters` turns any monitoring tool into a Mushi report source.
  - Datadog monitor alerts → Mushi report.
  - Honeycomb triggers → Mushi report.
  - New Relic alert policies → Mushi report.
  - Grafana Alertmanager / Loki → Mushi report.

  Each adapter exposes both a pure `translate<Vendor>()` function and a ready-to-mount `create<Vendor>WebhookHandler()` so Mushi slots in alongside whatever observability stack you already run.
