## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 6e01dc7: Ship `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `SECURITY.md` inside every published tarball, and enable npm provenance (sigstore-signed build attestation) for every publishable package. Both changes target package-health signals surfaced by Snyk (`security.snyk.io/package/npm/<name>`) and Socket (`socket.dev/npm/package/<name>`):
  - **Community files in-tarball.** Snyk and Socket only credit community signals when the files are shipped inside the npm tarball, not when they live at the monorepo root. A pre-commit guard (`scripts/sync-community-files.mjs --check`) and the `pnpm release` script now auto-sync from the canonical root copies to prevent drift.
  - **`publishConfig.provenance: true` everywhere.** The Release workflow already set `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE=true` at the job level, but per-package `publishConfig` is the explicit signal Socket reads for its Supply Chain score. `@mushi-mushi/cli`, `create-mushi-mushi`, and `mushi-mushi` already had it; the remaining 20 publishable packages now match.
  - **`.github/FUNDING.yml`** points at GitHub Sponsors so the repo exposes a funding signal to scanners and the GitHub UI.

  No runtime behaviour changes. No breaking changes for consumers.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 81336e9: Wave G2 — MCP becomes the agentic centerpiece.
  - `@mushi-mushi/mcp`: five new tools — `trigger_judge`, `dispatch_fix`, `transition_status`, `run_nl_query`, `get_knowledge_graph`. Existing tool endpoints corrected to match the backend API.
  - `@mushi-mushi/mcp-ci` (new package): GitHub Action + CLI (`mushi-mcp-ci`) with subcommands `trigger-judge`, `dispatch-fix`, `check-coverage`, `query`. Drop-in merge gate for PRs that must wait for Mushi judge pass before shipping.
