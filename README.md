# Mushi Mushi

**The bug your monitoring can't see, in your queue with a draft fix.**

Sentry catches what your code throws. Datadog catches what your infrastructure does. Firebase catches what your users _click_. Mushi catches what your users _feel_ — the dead button, the 12-second screen, the layout that breaks on one Android.

Mushi is the **synthesis layer**: the one signal none of your existing tools capture, with inbound adapters for **11 monitoring sources** (Sentry, Datadog, Bugsnag, Rollbar, Crashlytics, New Relic, Honeycomb, Grafana Loki, AWS CloudWatch, Opsgenie, Firebase Analytics) and **12 outbound plugins** (Sentry, Slack, Jira, Linear, PagerDuty, Discord, Microsoft Teams, GitHub Issues, Bugsnag, Rollbar, Crashlytics, Zapier) so every tool in your stack stays in the loop.

## Read this first if you're not a developer

A 60-second tour for product managers, designers, founders, and anyone who's ever heard "we'll fix it next sprint" three sprints in a row.

- **What it is** — A small "shake your phone to report a bug" button that drops into any web or mobile app in one line of code. It captures a screenshot, what the user was trying to do, and what their device looked like.
- **Why it's different** — Sentry, Datadog, and Firebase tell you when _code crashes_. They go quiet when a button looks clickable but isn't, when a page takes 12 seconds to load with no error, or when the layout looks broken on one phone model. Mushi catches those — the bugs your users _feel_ but your monitoring can't see.
- **What happens to a report** — An AI reads it within seconds, tags severity ("blocker", "minor"), groups duplicates ("the same broken button collapsed across 47 users"), and (optionally) hands the report to another AI that opens a draft pull request with the proposed code change. A human always reviews and merges.
- **Where your data lives** — Your own cloud (self-hosted), or ours. The free tier covers 1,000 reports a month with no credit card.
- **What it costs to run** — Mushi is the _plumbing_. You bring your own API keys for Anthropic / OpenAI / Sentry / Slack / etc., and you pay those vendors directly. We don't mark up LLM tokens or hold your data hostage. Most teams run the whole loop for under $20/month.
- **Who it's for** — Founders shipping a consumer product, PMs who live in support tickets, designers tired of "works on my machine", on-call engineers who want fewer 3 AM Slack pings.
- **Two-line install** — `npx mushi-mushi`. The wizard does the rest.

If you're a developer skip ahead to [Try it](#try-it). If you're an operator or platform engineer, jump to [Operator-grade plumbing](#operator-grade-plumbing) for the production checklist.

## What's new in v2 — bidirectional inventory + agentic-failure gates

Mushi v1 was the negative side: catch what your users _felt_ break and triage it.
**v2 adds the positive side**: a declarative `inventory.yaml` of user stories, pages, and actions — with five pre-release **gates** that fail the build when the agent's drafts diverge from the contract, and a **synthetic monitor** that re-walks the same surface against staging on a schedule.

- 🌱 **Sketch your app, not just its bugs.** A `User stories · Inventory` page (sidebar → User stories) groups every user-facing action under the story it serves and shows verified / unwired / regressed counts at a glance.
- 🤖 **The SDK proposes the inventory.** Turn on `capture.discoverInventory` and the SDK quietly observes routes, `data-testid`s, and outbound API paths in production — Claude drafts an `inventory.yaml` from the stream, you accept or edit. Most teams will never hand-author one.
- 🚦 **Five gates, one composite GitHub check.** `mushi-mushi/no-dead-handler` (empty `onClick`s), `mushi-mushi/no-mock-leak` (faker / "John Doe" arrays in non-test paths), inventory drift (added / removed / renamed actions), agentic-failure detection (handler regressions across deploys), and synthetic walk health.
- 🛰️ **Synthetic monitor** runs the inventory's `expected_outcome` checks against your staging URL on a cron — fail-closed by default, with explicit `synthetic_monitor_allow_mutations` opt-in for write paths.
- 🕸️ **Graph gets a Surface mode** — the same `Bug graph` toggles to a `Surface` view that overlays the positive inventory on the live knowledge graph so you can see the dead corners.
- 🧭 **Spec traceability is end-to-end (2026-05-09 release).** `expected_outcome` is a real schema field — its assertions ride along with every fix dispatch, get rendered into the LLM prompt, gate the PR through `validateAgainstSpec`, and trigger a _targeted_ synthetic probe against the originating Action the moment the PR opens. Every `fix_attempt` row records the inventory `Action` it was meant to repair (`inventory_action_node_id`), so the admin "Where this fix came from" drawer can show the same spec the agent saw. See [How spec traceability works](#how-spec-traceability-works) below for the full chain.
- 🔌 **First-class orchestrator interop.** Plug Mushi into Cursor, Claude Code, OpenAI Agents SDK, LangGraph, CrewAI, A2A v1.0.0 agents, or anything else: **MCP Streamable HTTP** at `/functions/v1/mcp` (2025-03-26 spec), **A2A `tasks` endpoints** at `/v1/a2a/tasks` (create / get / cancel / SSE subscribe), **OpenAPI 3.1** at `/openapi.json`, AG-UI v0.4 SSE accepts API keys (`mcp:read`), `SandboxProvider` is an open contract with a third-party registry, and JSON Schemas for `FixContext` / `FixResult` / `SandboxProvider` / `ExpectedOutcome` are served at `/v1/schemas/*`. See [Connecting your orchestrator](https://kensaur.us/mushi-mushi/docs/concepts/orchestrator-interop) for per-orchestrator recipes.
- 🧩 **Headless SDK widget.** `MushiTrigger` and `MushiAttach` let you attach the feedback reporter to any button, icon, or menu item in your existing design system — no floating stamp, no fixed position, just your UI opening Mushi on click. Works in React (polymorphic `as` prop) and React Native (`cloneElement` injection). See [Headless integration](#headless-sdk-integration).
- 🌐 **Multi-platform console.** Reports from iOS, Android, Web, and React Native are now filterable by platform and SDK package in the Reports list. Each report's detail drawer shows the "Device & Build" section with `sdk_version` and `app_version`. The Dashboard shows a **Platform Health** tile with 24h report volume per SDK.
- 🤖 **QA Coverage Suite.** Define automated user-story tests as natural-language prompts or Playwright scripts, schedule them on cron, and run them via **Firecrawl Actions** (default, no setup), **Browserbase** (BYOK, cloud Chromium), or **local Playwright** (CLI). Pass/fail history appears on a dedicated `/qa-coverage` page and a dashboard tile. When you generate a Playwright test from a report, Mushi automatically creates a QA story so it runs on a weekly schedule as a regression guard. See [QA Coverage Suite](#qa-coverage-suite).

Get started in any project that already has Mushi installed:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/mushi-gates.yml
- uses: kensaurus/mushi-mushi/packages/mcp-ci@master
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.MUSHI_API_KEY }}
    project-id: ${{ secrets.MUSHI_PROJECT_ID }}
    command: gates # also: propose · discover-api · discovery-status · auth-bootstrap
```

Inside your IDE the same commands are exposed as MCP tools via [`@mushi-mushi/mcp`](./packages/mcp/), so Cursor / Claude Code / Copilot can run them on your behalf. From the admin UI you click _Run gates_ / _Run crawler_ directly on each row of the User stories page.

Full schema in [`@mushi-mushi/inventory-schema`](./packages/inventory-schema/), ESLint rules in [`eslint-plugin-mushi-mushi`](./packages/eslint-plugin-mushi-mushi/), the auth-bootstrap helper in [`@mushi-mushi/inventory-auth-runner`](./packages/inventory-auth-runner/).

## How spec traceability works

The most-asked v2 question is "how do you keep agent work tied back to the original spec once implementation starts?" Honest answer: until the 2026-05-09 release the read side was tight and the write side was a U-turn — the worker dropped the inventory pointer the moment dispatch started. That's now closed end-to-end.

```

What the agent sees in its prompt today (rendered by `renderSpecContext`):

```markdown
## Inventory Spec Context (whitepaper §2.10 spec-traceability)

This fix was dispatched against a tracked Action in the project's `inventory.yaml`.
The agent and the reviewer MUST keep the diff scoped to making the action work as
specified — do NOT refactor unrelated code or break sibling actions on the same page.

- Action: `signup-form: submit`
- Description: Submit the signup form and create a new user
- Page: `/signup` (id=`signup`)
- User story: New user signup (`signup`)

### Expected outcome contract (success criteria after fix)

- Summary: POST /signup returns 200 and creates a user row
- HTTP status MUST be one of: 200, 201
- Response body assertions:
  - `$.user.id` exists
- Database: `public.users` MUST row_exists
- UI MUST show text containing: "Welcome"
- UI MUST navigate to: `/dashboard`

After the PR merges, the synthetic monitor will probe the action against this
contract. A draft fix that the synthetic monitor will then immediately mark
`regressed` is worse than no fix at all.
```

The same anchor flows out to every external surface — Cursor / Claude Code / OpenAI Agents SDK / LangGraph / CrewAI / A2A all get the inventory Action and its `expected_outcome` via the MCP `get_fix_context` tool, the A2A Task `metadata.inventoryActionNodeId` field, or the dispatch row's column directly.

## When this matters to you

Your existing monitoring is excellent at one thing: telling you what your code threw. It can't tell you any of these:

- A user added a coupon and the pay button slipped under their keyboard.
- A new signup tapped _Save_ twice because nothing visibly happened the first time.
- A Pro customer's dashboard takes 12 seconds to load and they've started using the competitor's tab in the meantime.
- A layout that looks fine on your laptop folds in half on the one Android model used by 18% of your traffic.
- A feature regressed two deploys ago. Three users emailed support; two just churned.

These never trigger an alert. Your users just leave. Mushi gives them a way to tell you while the moment is still fresh — so the bug your monitoring missed lands in your triage queue, classified, deduped, and (optionally) with a draft PR already open.

---

## Try it

```bash
npx mushi-mushi
```

The wizard auto-detects your framework (Next.js / Nuxt / SvelteKit / Angular / Expo / Capacitor / plain React, Vue, Svelte / vanilla JS), installs the right SDK, writes `MUSHI_PROJECT_ID` and `MUSHI_API_KEY` to `.env.local`, and prints the snippet to paste in. Equivalent commands:

```bash
npm create mushi-mushi              # via the npm-create convention
npx @mushi-mushi/cli init           # the scoped name
```

Or install directly if you already know which SDK you want:

```bash
npm install @mushi-mushi/react      # also covers Next.js
```

```tsx
import { MushiProvider } from '@mushi-mushi/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <MushiProvider
      config={{
        projectId: 'proj_xxx',
        apiKey: 'mushi_xxx',
        // v2.1 — opt in to passive inventory discovery (off by default).
        // Routes, testids, and outbound API paths flow into the proposer
        // so Claude can draft an inventory.yaml for you to accept.
        capture: { discoverInventory: true },
      }}
    >
      <YourApp />
    </MushiProvider>
  );
}
```

Your users now have a shake-to-report widget. Reports land in your admin console, classified within seconds — and (with `discoverInventory`) your inventory drafts itself from the same stream.

## How the loop runs

When a user shakes their phone, four things happen in roughly the order you'd expect a careful colleague to do them:

1. **Capture.** The widget grabs the screenshot, the route, the user's note, the last few console + network events, and the device context. Everything they were doing, plus everything that broke.
2. **Classify.** A two-stage LLM pipeline (Haiku fast-filter → Sonnet deep + vision) tags severity, category, and root-cause hint in plain English. A nightly Sonnet judge scores the classifier's own work and feeds a prompt-A/B loop, so the labels you see come from prompts that have earned their place.
3. **Connect.** The report embeds into a knowledge graph (Postgres + pgvector). The same broken button reported twenty times shows up as one row, not twenty.
4. **Fix.** _Optional._ You click _Dispatch fix_ (or wire the same action into Slack, MCP, or CI) and an agent in a sandbox tries the change, runs your tests, and opens a draft PR. You review it like any other PR — and merge, change, or close it.

## What you get on day one

- **You see one report per actual bug, not twenty.** Dedup runs against the knowledge graph, so the same broken button collapses across users and devices.
- **Your queue is already triaged.** Severity, category, and a one-line root-cause hint are there before you click in.
- **Your users get a way to tell you.** A 14 KB shake-to-report widget that doesn't pretend to be a chat bot and doesn't ask them to write a ticket.
- **Your auto-fix is opt-in and reviewable.** The agent opens a _draft_ PR. You merge it, edit it, or close it — the loop never bypasses you.
- **Your existing tools keep working.** Mushi sits next to Sentry; it does not replace it. Sentry breadcrumbs flow into Mushi's classifier, and Mushi reports flow back as Sentry User Feedback if you want them to.

## Headless SDK integration

By default the SDK injects a floating 🐛 stamp button. If you want the reporter embedded in your own UI instead, use the headless primitives:

### React — `MushiTrigger`

```tsx
import { MushiTrigger } from '@mushi-mushi/react'

// Any element: button, anchor, div, custom component
<MushiTrigger as="button" category="bug" className="my-feedback-btn">
  Report a bug
</MushiTrigger>

// With Radix / shadcn
<MushiTrigger as={Button} variant="ghost" size="sm">
  Feedback
</MushiTrigger>
```

All native props are forwarded. The `onClick` chain is preserved — if the host button calls `e.preventDefault()` Mushi will not open.

### React — `MushiAttach`

Attach the reporter to an element you can't wrap (third-party widget, portal):

```tsx
import { MushiAttach } from '@mushi-mushi/react'

// Renders nothing — just wires the click listener
<MushiAttach selector="#help-button" category="bug" />
```

### React Native — `MushiTrigger`

```tsx
import { MushiTrigger } from '@mushi-mushi/react-native'

<MushiTrigger>
  <Pressable style={styles.btn}>
    <Text>Report a bug</Text>
  </Pressable>
</MushiTrigger>
```

### SDK Install Card

The admin console's **SDK Install** page (Get started → Configure & install the SDK) has a four-option **Trigger mode** chooser: Attach to my button (recommended), Floating stamp, Edge tab, and Headless (manual). The snippet preview updates in real time to show the correct import and usage pattern.

## QA Coverage Suite

Define user-story tests as prompts or Playwright scripts and schedule them to run automatically.

### Quick start

1. Go to **Check → QA Coverage** in the sidebar.
2. Click **+ New story** and describe the test in natural language.
3. Pick a provider (Firecrawl by default — no API key needed).
4. The story runs hourly and results appear on the page and the Dashboard tile.

### Providers

| Provider | Requirements | Best for |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `firecrawl_actions` | None (default) | Content verification, navigation checks, link health |
| `browserbase` | `BYOK_BROWSERBASE_API_KEY` in project settings | Complex UI interactions, JavaScript-heavy SPAs |
| `local` | CLI runner (`mushi-dev run-qa-stories`) | Full Playwright access, local-only environments |

### Connecting to user stories

When you click **Generate test from report** on a report, Mushi writes a Playwright script, opens a GitHub PR, and automatically creates a QA story for it — scheduled weekly as a regression guard.

### BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)

Story runners use your own API keys stored in `mushi_runtime_config`. No key → story is skipped with a clear reason. Key resolution order: project-level override → org-level override → Mushi platform default (Firecrawl only).

### Dashboard integration

The **QA Coverage** tile on `/dashboard` shows: total stories, % passing (≥80% pass rate), and the top failing story. Click "View all →" to open the full `/qa-coverage` page.

### A2A failure notifications

If a story fails and your project has an A2A endpoint configured, `qa-story-runner` pushes a structured failure notification to connected agents (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) via the A2A protocol.

## Multi-platform console

### Filtering reports by platform / SDK

The Reports list (`/reports`) has **Platform** and **SDK** filter dropdowns. Options: iOS, Android, Web, macOS, Windows (platform); Web, React, React Native, Capacitor (SDK package). Selecting a value appends `?platform=ios` (or `?sdk_package=@mushi-mushi/react-native`) to the URL for shareability.

### Device & Build panel

Each report detail page shows a **Device & Build** section with:
- `platform` — iOS / Android / Web / …
- `sdk_package` — `@mushi-mushi/react`, `@mushi-mushi/react-native`, etc.
- `sdk_version` — the SDK version that filed the report
- `app_version` — the app's own version string (if provided)

### Platform Health dashboard tile

The **Platform Health · 24h** tile on `/dashboard` shows report volume, error counts, and SDK version list per platform, sourced from the `qa_platform_rollup_24h` materialized view (refreshed hourly). Click any row to drill into `/reports?platform=<platform>`.

## Operator-grade plumbing

Mushi is the _intermediary_. We deliberately avoid replicating Sentry / Datadog / Firebase — instead we ship the boring-but-essential standards that let those tools talk to each other through one console, with one audit trail, and one consistent agent-facing API.

| Area                 | Working                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Still partial                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The orchestrator **refuses to run `local-noop` in production** unless you explicitly set `MUSHI_ALLOW_LOCAL_SANDBOX=1`. Pick `e2b` (or implement `SandboxProvider` yourself) before exposing autofix to production traffic.

## Where Mushi fits

Every team we talk to already runs three kinds of monitoring. Mushi is the fourth layer none of them cover.

| Signal                 | Typical tools                          | What they miss                                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code-thrown errors     | Sentry, Crashlytics, Bugsnag, Rollbar  | Bugs that don't throw — dead buttons, janky scroll, 12-second screens |
| System telemetry       | Datadog, New Relic, Honeycomb, Grafana | The user's perspective on what that latency spike felt like           |
| Product analytics      | Firebase Analytics, PostHog, Amplitude | _Why_ a funnel step was abandoned, in the user's own words            |
| **User-felt friction** | **nothing → Mushi**                    | —                                                                     |

Mushi is the **synthesis layer**, not a replacement. It adds the one signal that's missing, and ingests the others so a single classified bug row can carry everything at once: the stack trace from Crashlytics, the latency spike from Datadog, the funnel drop from Firebase, AND the user's screenshot and note.

### Compared to each tool you already have

|                              | Sentry / Crashlytics        | Datadog / New Relic       | Firebase / Amplitude    | **Mushi Mushi**                               |
| ---------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------ | :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Signal origin**            | Code throws                 | Infrastructure metrics    | User event streams      | User-felt friction, captured in the moment    |
| **What lands in your queue** | Stack trace                 | Alert threshold breach    | Funnel drop-off         | User note + screenshot + device context       |
| **Repeat signal**            | Same error = separate issue | Spike repeats → new alert | Conversion drops again  | Same broken button collapses to one row       |
| **Closing the loop**         | Assign a ticket             | Write a runbook           | A/B test the conversion | Optional draft PR you merge, edit, or close   |
| **From your IDE**            | Paste issue ID into Cursor  | —                         | —                       | Cursor reads the report and proposes the diff |
| **Where it runs**            | Their cloud                 | Their cloud               | Google cloud            | Yours, ours, or both                          |

Mushi is already wired to send signals **back** to the tools you run — 12 outbound plugins covering Sentry, Slack, Jira, Linear, PagerDuty, Discord, Microsoft Teams, GitHub Issues, Bugsnag, Rollbar, Crashlytics, and Zapier — and to **receive** alerts from 11 inbound sources (Sentry, Datadog, Bugsnag, Rollbar, Crashlytics, New Relic, Honeycomb, Grafana Loki, AWS CloudWatch, Opsgenie, Firebase Analytics) via [`@mushi-mushi/adapters`](./packages/adapters). You don't replace anything; you add the layer that completes the picture.

The marketing landing at [`kensaur.us/mushi-mushi/`](https://kensaur.us/mushi-mushi/) walks the full integration story.

## Run it

**Hosted (zero-config).** Sign up at [`kensaur.us/mushi-mushi/`](https://kensaur.us/mushi-mushi/), click _Start free, no card_, create a project, and copy your `projectId` + `apiKey`. The free tier covers 1,000 reports a month.

**Self-hosted.** A single Docker Compose file gets you a working stack against your own Supabase project:

```bash
cd deploy
cp .env.example .env   # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, Supabase creds
docker compose up -d
```

[`SELF_HOSTED.md`](./SELF_HOSTED.md) is the long-form guide. A production-ready **Helm chart** lives at [`deploy/helm/`](./deploy/helm/README.md) — pre-install `Job` applies all 138 SQL migrations from a bundled ConfigMap (`pnpm sync:helm-migrations` keeps it fresh; CI guards drift). One `helm install` on any cluster.

> **Internal edge functions** (`fast-filter`, `classify-report`, `fix-worker`, `judge-batch`, `intelligence-report`, `usage-aggregator`, `soc2-evidence`, `generate-synthetic`) authenticate via the shared `requireServiceRoleAuth` middleware. Never expose them with `--no-verify-jwt` in production. Only the public `api` function should face the internet — see [`packages/server/README.md`](./packages/server/README.md#internal-caller-authentication-sec-1).

## Packages

Most developers only install **one** SDK package — `npx mushi-mushi` picks the right one for you and pulls in `core` and `web` automatically.

making it hard for bad actors to ship a malicious copy under our name.
